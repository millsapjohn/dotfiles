# WhiteboxTools for Processing

This plugin implements WhiteboxTools provider for QGIS Processing
framework.

WhiteboxTools is an advanced geospatial data analysis engine created by
Prof. [John Lindsay](https://jblindsay.github.io/ghrg/index.html) at the
at the University of Guelph's Geomorphometry and Hydrogeomatics Research
Group. It is intended to provide a platform for advanced geospatial data
analysis with applications in both environmental research and the
geomatics industry. Also it was envisioned from the outset as providing
an ideal platform for experimenting with novel geospatial analysis
methods.

Processing is a geoprocessing environment that can be used to call
native and third party algorithms from QGIS, making your spatial
analysis tasks more productive and easy to accomplish.

Based on the WhiteboxTools 2.0.0
