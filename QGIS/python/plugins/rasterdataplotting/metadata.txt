description=Create plots visualizing raster data for all pixels currently visible inside the map canvas.
version=1.6.3
about=The Raster Data Plotting plugin adds a panel for creating i) spectral/temporal pixel profile plots and ii) 2-d scatter/density plots visualizing all visible pixel for two selected raster bands. The scatter plot data is adapting in real-time, whenever the map canvas extent changes. See the project homepage for a detailed overview and usage instructions.

changelog=1.6.3
    - Fixed broken scatter plots for recent scipy versions (issue #8). (TypeError: ufunc 'isfinite' not supported for the input types, and the inputs could not be safely coerced to any supported types according to the casting rule ''safe'')
    1.6.2
    - Fixed Python 3.8 issue (AttributeError: module 'time' has no attribute 'clock').
    1.6.1
    - Fixed import error (..site.RasterTimeseriesManager)
    1.6
    - Reintroduced Spectral Profile Plots.
    - Reintroduced Temporal Profile Plots (RasterTimeseriesManager plugin version >= v1.5.1 required).
    1.5
    - Added controls for curve fitting (linear, quadratic, cubic, exponential, logarithmic) and correlation analysis (Pearson correlation).
    - Added option to run the analysis on the whole raster.
    - Added support for temporal linkage to the Raster Timeseries Manager plugin (version >= v1.5 required).
    - Support all QGIS color ramps for density plots.
    1.4
    - Added controls for selecting spatial region of interests (ROI), i.e. features from a vector layer.
      Allows to focus the analysis on specific regions in the map canvas (e.g. urban, forest or agriculture areas).
      Scatter plot can be colorized using the layer styling symbol colors.
    - Added control for toggling automatic binning to native screen resolution, i.e. one bin matches exactly one screen pixel.
    1.3
    - Added control for toggling data plotting on/off.
    - Added controls for adjusting axes ranges.
    - Added controls for adjusting histogram contrast stretch.
    - Added controls for creating region of interests (ROI) inside the scatter plot.
      Pixels that fall into a ROI are overlayed/colorized inside the map canvas.
    1.2.1
    - Moved external PyQtGraph dependency into the plugin.
    1.2
    - Added spectral and temporal profile plots.
    - Renamed pluging from "Raster Data Plotly" to "Raster Data Plotting".
    1.1
    - Added on the fly reprojection of the extent from map canvas CRS to layer CRS
    - Fixed wrong tracker and repository links.
    1.0.1
    - Fixed icon.
    1.0
    - Initial upload.
